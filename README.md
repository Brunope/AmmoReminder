# Ammo Reminder
A Classic World of Warcraft addon for all you huntards that
run out of ammo. When you are near a vendor that sells ammo, Ammo Reminder
pops up a message reminding you to buy some.

## Version 1.0
In v1, only Horde vendors will be fully supported.

## Notes
I'll be updating this day 1 of classic with stuff that's hard for me to test right now.

## TODO
I plan to make many improvements:
* ~~Support bullet vendors~~
* ~~Add remaining ammo count to reminder message~~
* ~~Check currently equipped ammo to suggest either bullet vs arrow vendor~~
* Disable reminders when passing through on a flight path
* ~~Don't remind if ammo amount is over a certain threshold~~
* Reminder when you get into a 5-man group, since you're probably going to a dungeon
* Reminder wherever you are when running really low on ammo
* Configuration options for the previous 3 items
* Configuration option to change how reminder is displayed (chat, message popup, etc.)
* Find nearest ammo vendor button/arrow
* Mayyybe support alliance scrubs
