# Ammo Reminder
A Classic World of Warcraft addon for all you huntards that
run out of ammo. When you are near a vendor that sells ammo, Ammo Reminder
pops up a message reminding you to buy some.

## Version 1.0
In v1, only Horde arrow vendors will be fully supported. Some bullet vendors will be found, but not all.

## Future Versions
I plan to make many improvements:
* Support bullet vendors
* Add remaining ammo count to reminder message
* Check currently equipped ammo to suggest either bullet vs arrow vendor
* Reminder when you get into a 5-man group, since you're probably going to a dungeon
* Reminder when running low on ammo for your equipped weapon type
* Configuration options for the previous two items
* Configuration option to disable reminders entirely when ammo amount is above a certain threshold
* Configuration option to change how reminder is displayed (chat, message popup, etc.)
* Mayyybe support alliance scrubs
