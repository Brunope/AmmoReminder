# Ammo Reminder

A Classic World of Warcraft addon for all you huntards that
run out of ammo. If you're somewhat low on ammo and near a vendor
that sells it, Ammo Reminder pops up a message reminding you to 
buy some. Works with both arrows and bullets, depending on your
equipped weapon type. 

[Download version 1.0](https://github.com/Brunope/AmmoReminder/archive/v1.0.zip)

## Notes
In v1, only Horde vendors are fully supported. Only works with hunters.

I'll hopefully update this day 1 of classic with stuff that's hard
for me to test right now.

## Usage
/ar or /ammoreminder in chat to bring up the options page
