# Ammo Reminder
A Classic World of Warcraft addon for all you huntards that
run out of ammo. If you're somewhat low on ammo and near a vendor
that sells it, Ammo Reminder pops up a message reminding you to 
buy some. Works with both arrows and bullets, depending on your
equipped weapon type.

## Version 1.0
In v1, only Horde vendors will be fully supported.

I'll be updating this day 1 of classic with stuff that's hard
for me to test right now.

## TODO
* ~~Support bullet vendors~~
* ~~Add remaining ammo count to reminder message~~
* ~~Check currently equipped ammo to suggest either bullet vs arrow vendor~~
* Disable reminders when passing through on a flight path
* ~~Don't remind if ammo amount is over a certain threshold~~
* Reminder when you get into a 5-man group, since you're probably going to a dungeon
* Reminder wherever you are when running really low on ammo
* Configuration options for the previous 3 items
* Configuration option to change how reminder is displayed (chat, message popup, etc.)
* When level 60, only remind when near an Auction House (+config option)
* ~~Shove all public functions into a class to avoid collisions~~
* Find nearest ammo vendor button/arrow
* Mayyybe support alliance scrubs
